I'm a senior at Caltech interested in Astrophysics and Electrical Engineering. This summer of 2024, I'm working on the analog front end for the prototype Caltech All-Sky All The Time Array (CASATTA), a collaboration between the Caltech Radio Astronomy group, led by Prof. Vikram Ravi, and a group within the Australian CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science (CASS) led by Dr. Keith Bannister. CASATTA seeks to build the first scientifically useful wide-field phased array of antennas for frequencies \>400MHz. Check out my proposal for this project [here](/Michael_Gutierrez_SURF_Proposal_2024_CASATTA.pdf)!

Before starting at Caltech, I used the COVID times as an opportunity to take a gap year in 2020-2021, which I spent interning at [Xos Trucks](https://xostrucks.com) and [H2Ok Innovations](https://h2okinnovations.com). During Summer 2022, I worked on the [AERO-VISTA CubeSat](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/geospace/geospace-projects/aero-vista-cubesat-mission/) mission at MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford, MA. During Summer 2023, I studied Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at the University of Copenhagen as part of Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). That project was graciously sponsored by the David L. Glackin Memorial SURF Fund.

I hail from Sarasota, FL. In my free time, I love making music on the guitar and tuba, going hiking and rock climbing, and tinkering with old electronics (I'm also a licensed ham radio operator!)
